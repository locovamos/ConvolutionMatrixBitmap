# ConvolutionMatrixBitmap

Convolution Matrix on Bitmap Images in C language

I implemented an interface that apply matrix on Bitmap images by using convolution algorithm 

I did this during my 4th Semester (S4) at EPITA 

I used GTK3 and standard library


To launch the app, go to the directory executable_app:

First step:

Write on the shell "chmod u+x kernelfilter.sh"

Last step:

Write on the shell "./kernelfilter.sh"

The app is ready to use.



To add a kernel filter to the image, please do the following steps:

First step:

Choose a picture that can be found in the images directory(has to be .bmp)


Second step:

Select the filter you want

(if you select customed kernel,do not forget to enter values)


Last step:

Click on the button Add filter/kernel

A window is gonna open and will show you the image with and without the filter

When you quit the app, please do these following steps:

First step:

Write on the shell "chmod u+x clean.sh"

Last step:

Write on the shell "./clean.sh"
